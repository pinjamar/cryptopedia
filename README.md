# Project Cryptopedia

This is a cryptocurrency app that uses APIs and Redux. You can find Top 100 coins here together with their basic informations. It also includes crypto news & exchanges and the idea is to include a lot more stuff down the road. I will try to add more APIs and get more detailed data about the coins.
